# B2 API Integration Plan

## Status: Awaiting Checkpoint 3 (B1 → B2 handoff)

## Tasks for Replacement Developer:
1. WAIT for: Profile Edit, Admin Event Management, Registration List components
2. AFTER Checkpoint 3: Connect each component to API
3. Implement 4 connections:
   - Profile form → API
   - Event management → API  
   - Registration list → API
   - CSV export → API

## Files that will need modification:
- Any component files handed off from A1/A2
- Use API service functions from A1

## Do NOT start until:
✓ All components received from A1/A2
✓ B1 has added validation
✓ Team confirms Checkpoint 3 reached
